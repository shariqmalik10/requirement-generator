# Notebook Requirement Generator Tool
This is a tool I have created to generate requirements.txt file. 
It is in early development so there may be issues and bugs. 

# How to use 
1. Clone the repo 
2. Navigate to the cloned repo 
3. Run the following command to generate the requirements.txt file 

Command
```git

python3 requirements_generator.py '/path/to/notebook'

```

Note:
- The tool was created and tested on Python version 3.11 so ensure you have a similar setting to avoid issues 

- Going to update so that it generates the requirements.txt in the folder the user wants, not just the default folder
